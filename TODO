- (PARTIAL) read in game data from external file (e.g. JSON) instead of having a static Constants class
    - made an Assets class that reads from a .csv file to load building (tier) data, remains to extend this to upgrades and upgrade requirements
- (DONE) make tooltips for "tier" buttons work the same as for "upgrade" buttons for coherence
- save/load...
