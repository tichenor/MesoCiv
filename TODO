- (PARTIAL) read in game data from external file (e.g. JSON) instead of having a static Constants class
    - made an Assets class that reads from a .csv file to load building (tier) data, remains to extend this to upgrades and upgrade requirements

- (DONE) make tooltips for "tier" buttons work the same as for "upgrade" buttons for coherence

- save/load...

- gradle/maven?

- find some better way to access/store generators than to have them appended to an array world.generators in order

- fix upgrade appearing multiple times if leveling past level requirement without purchasing upgrade

- work on a cleaner solution to loading and initializing tiers and tier upgrades (Assets and GameManager)

- change the delimiter in .csv files to not be a comma so that descriptions can use it without having to create a workaround
