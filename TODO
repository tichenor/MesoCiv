- (DONE) read in game data from external file (e.g. JSON) instead of having a static Constants class
    - made an Assets class that reads from a .csv file to load building (tier) data, remains to extend this to upgrades and upgrade requirements

- (DONE) make tooltips for "tier" buttons work the same as for "upgrade" buttons for coherence

- (DONE) implemented a "radio box" that displays various information and notifications to the user, such as new upgrades
    becoming available, achievements unlocking, etc.

- save/load...

- gradle/maven?

- find some better way to access/store generators than to have them appended to an array world.generators in order

-  (DONE) fix upgrade appearing multiple times if leveling past level requirement without purchasing upgrade

- (PARTIAL) work on a cleaner solution to loading and initializing tiers and tier upgrades (Assets and GameManager)
    - done, but there might be cleaner solutions

- (DONE) change the delimiter in .csv files to not be a comma so that descriptions can use it without having to create a workaround

- (PARTIAL) tidy up the Progress Manager, make it work nicely with property tags, and make properties & achievements load in
    from .csv files.
    - Progress Manager can update properties based on tags, but tag system can be extended. Global upgrades are generated
        with their corresponding "unlocking achievement" from .csv. An upgrade becomes available when the achievement
        is unlocked in the Progress Manager.

- prestige system

- make tier labels correctly take into account global multipliers for the production increase per tier purchased

- more currency systems...
